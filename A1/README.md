# Objective

This assignment aims to give students hands-on experience in migrating a traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) to a NoSQL database (MongoDB) and evaluating queries on the migrated data using Apache Spark. This assignment will cover the following key areas:

1. Data modelling and transformation from a relational model to a document-based model.
2. Data migration and loading into MongoDB.
3. Querying the data using Apache Spark with MongoDB as the data source.
4. Performance analysis and optimization techniques.

# Scenario

We have a university's existing student information system in PostgreSQL. The system includes tables such as **Students**, **Courses**, **Enrollments**, **Instructors**, and **Departments**. The university wishes to migrate this data to a MongoDB database to leverage its flexibility and scalability.
